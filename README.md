# Personal Skills Radar

Spike for fun, attempt to give hints on what should you practice/learn next.

Skills are read-only at the moment. You can make it 'yours' by forking and editing [this file](app/scripts/controllers/main.js).


## Development 

```
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

## Contributing 

I am learning Angular along the way, so pull requests/issues with good practices welcomed.
